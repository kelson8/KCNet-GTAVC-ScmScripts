# GTAVC-ScmScripts
This repo will contain a lot of testing that I am creating for VC and ReVC, I am using some of the original scripts as a base for this.

### test-main folder
* add_blips.sc - Add most blips from the original scripts
* import.sc - Blank script
* setup_barriers.sc - Setup the barriers for the bridges and disable the ped paths, this can be toggled by changing 0 to 1 in the file.
* setup_game.sc - Add never wanted, infinite health, and extra money toggles into this file, I will possibly move the player stuff into here.
* setup_garages.sc - Setup the pay n spray garages.
* setup_teleporters.sc - Setup the teleport markers on the map, incomplete.


### Root folder
* compile.bat - This will compile using gta3sc.exe if found, it'll copy to what path is set in the copy.bat file.
* copy.bat - Called from compile.bat which copies a file to the folder.
